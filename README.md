# Java Internals Visualizer (JIV)

> **"Chrome DevTools for the JVM"** — See your Java program think, in real-time.

JIV is an educational and debugging platform that visualizes how Java programs execute inside the JVM. Paste any Java program, hit Run, and watch stack frames, heap objects, references, garbage collection, and threads come alive — line by line, animated, interactive.

## Configuration

- **CORS Origins**: The allowed origins for the backend API are now configurable via the `jiv.cors.allowed-origins` property in `application.yml`. This replaces the previous hard‑coded `http://localhost:3000` value.
- **CPU Limit**: The sandbox CPU limit can be adjusted with the `jiv.sandbox.cpu-limit` property (default `0.5`).
- **Class Name Validation**: `ExecutionService` now validates the user‑provided main class name to guard against malformed inputs.
- **Error Reporting**: `JvmSnapshot` includes an `errorMessage` field to convey execution errors without overloading the bytecode payload.

# Start backend
cd backend
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-Djiv.sandbox.agent-jar-path=$(pwd)/../agent/target/jiv-agent-1.0.0.jar"
```

### 4. Full Stack with Docker Compose

```bash

## How It Works

### Bytecode Instrumentation & Shadow Stack (ASM)

The JIV Java Agent attaches to the user's JVM using the `-javaagent` flag. At class load time, **ASM** rewrites every compiled user class to inject callbacks to `JivRuntime` at:
- **Method Entry (`onMethodEnter`)**: Captures input parameters, argument values, and pushes a new shadow frame.
- **Source Line Change (`visitLineNumber`)**: Synchronizes the visualizer's active editor line highlighting.
- **Method Exit (`onMethodExit`)**: Pops the shadow frame and collects return values.

`JivRuntime` maintains a local thread-safe **shadow stack** mirroring the real JVM execution frame states.

### Reflection Heap Walker (BFS Reachability)

At every line step, JIV runs a customized Garbage Collection simulation:
1. **Roots Identification**: The walker starts at active local variables and parameters on all shadow stack frames.
2. **Breadth-First Search**: Traverses the memory graph by analyzing object fields and array elements using Java Reflection.
3. **Reachability Mapping**: Marks all visited objects as `reachable: true` and calculates their reference counts. Objects that lost all root links are flagged as `reachable: false` and turn red inside the canvas, simulating dereferencing prior to a GC sweep.
4. **JVM Module Safety**: Wrapping field access in try-catch blocks ensures that modular encapsulation boundaries in Java 9+ do not crash the runner during core library traversal.

### Generational GC Aging

Objects are tracked inside a long-lived heap registry. Every time `GarbageCollectorMXBean` indicates a GC sweep has occurred:
- **Young Gen**: Objects are initialized with age `0` and a soft green theme.
- **Survivor Gen**: If an object remains reachable after a GC sweep, its age increments. Upon reaching age `2`, it graduates to `SURVIVOR` gen (soft amber).
- **Old (Tenured) Gen**: If it survives up to age `4`, it transitions to `OLD` gen (soft violet).
- **GC sweep**: Unreachable objects are removed from the heap diagram on the subsequent frame.

### Thread Monitors & Deadlock Detection

JIV interfaces with `ThreadMXBean` to monitor concurrency execution:
- **Lock Mapping**: Resolves owned monitors and waiting locks, translating raw identity hashcodes into JIV Heap object IDs. This shows `owns lock` or `waiting on lock` badges on thread cards and links them directly to the corresponding heap nodes.
- **Deadlock Detection**: Calls `findDeadlockedThreads()` to locate cyclic locking chains. Deadlocked threads are highlighted with red alerts, and the **AI Observability Coach** breaks down the circular dependency.

### Structured Concurrency & Virtual Threads

- **Virtual Threads**: Resolves carrier platform threads dynamically via reflection, visualizing virtual tasks nested inside their executing scheduler threads.
- **Hierarchical Scopes**: Reflectively inspects Java 21 `StructuredTaskScope` owners (mapping the `Thread.container` field) to construct hierarchical parent-child thread trees in the UI.

### Spring Boot DI Simulator

- **Stereotype Scanning**: The agent's bytecode transformer intercepts class definitions to detect custom annotations (`@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`).
- **Dependency Mapping**: Inspects fields for `@Autowired` annotations to map dependencies.
- **Bean Context Panel**: Resolves bean links before runtime initialization and visualizes the dependency injection graph on a dedicated dashboard.

### AI Observability Coach (Live NIM Integration)

- **Source Code Context**: Integrates the user's active Java source statement and full program code directly into the AI prompt payload alongside the JVM snapshot data.
- **Nvidia NIM Proxy**: Relays the data to a secure Next.js API route (`app/api/ai/route.ts`), which queries `meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct` using `NVIDIA_API_KEY`.
- **Auto-Explain Mode**: Includes an "Auto-explain" checkbox in the UI. When active, it automatically triggers a debounced (600ms) Llama diagnostic fetch on every line/step change, preventing API spam while time-traveling.
- **Contextual Explanations**: Diagnoses the exact cause-and-effect relationship between the user's Java statement and JVM heap allocations, stack unwinding, deadlocks, lock monitors, or thread carriers.

### Time-Travel Debugging

Every snapshot is an **immutable, complete record** of the entire JVM state at that step. This means:
- You can scrub to any point without replaying — just load that snapshot
- The Zustand store holds all snapshots in memory as an array
- The scrubber slider simply changes `currentStep` — all panels re-render instantly

### Heap Graph

The React Flow canvas converts `heap: Record<string, HeapObject>` into nodes/edges:
- Each `HeapObject` → one React Flow node
- Each `field.value` that is an object ID (`obj_NNN`) → one directed edge
- Node color = GC generation (Young=green, Survivor=amber, Old=violet)
- Unreachable nodes turn red when a GC event fires

## Environment Variables

### Frontend (`.env.local`)

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=http://localhost:8080/ws
NVIDIA_API_KEY=your_nvidia_nim_api_key
```

### Backend (`application.yml`)

```yaml
spring.datasource.url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/jivdb
spring.data.redis.host: localhost
jiv.sandbox.timeout-seconds: 15
jiv.sandbox.memory-limit-mb: 256
```

---

## Security

- User code runs in a Docker container with:
  - `--network=none` (no network access)
  - `--memory=256m` (memory limit)
  - `--cpus=0.5` (CPU limit)
  - `--read-only` (read-only filesystem)
  - 15-second execution timeout
- No user code ever runs on the host JVM directly

---
